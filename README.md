An application to search for different dog breed images.
Type in the dog breed that you want to search for in the search bar and then click the "search breeds" button, a grid of images of the breed should appear. When you hove the clicker over an image, it will appear slightly larger.
Technologies used are html, css, and js.
For future improvement I would like to:
1. Add imformation about the breed searched for such as size, weight, and activity level.
2. Have an alternative function where the user can input an image of a dog and it will display the most similar dog breeds.
3. Add the ability to click on an image that will lead to a full/larger version of the image selected.
